# Data-Cleaning-and-Processing-in-R-Language

Hello team, how are you?

This personal project is related to a didactic exercise that is part of my learning in ETL processes, more specifically, Data Cleaning and Treatment with the R language. Data must be routinely processed and cleaned to be well-utilized in future analyses or in AI and machine learning models. Therefore, this step is essential in the data analysis science process.
